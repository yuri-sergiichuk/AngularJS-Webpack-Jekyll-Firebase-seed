AngularJS + Webpack + Jekyll + Firebase seed
===========

This repository contains example of the web application that uses:
* AngularJS (client side framework)
* Webpack (as build system)
* Jekyll (as static content generator)
* Firebase (as hosting)

# Prerequisites

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)


# How to build

Use `npm` scripts in order to provide real-time updates of both Angular app
and Jekyll generated content.

In order to run webpack watcher run:
```
npm run webpack:watch
```

In order to run Jekyll web server run:
```
npm run start
```

## What is used in the background?

Webpack uses Bible in order to transpile ES6 JS cone into ES5-compatible one.

Webpack's watchers are used to provide real-time updates of the resulting transpiled 
code base to Jekyll.

Jekyll generates and serves static content.

Firebase uploads generated by Jekyll content to its hosting.

## How to deploy

1. Configure your Firebase account
2. Login into account using `firebase login`
4. Run `npm run deploy -- --project <YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID>` in order to re-build everything and deploy your app
